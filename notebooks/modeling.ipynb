    "## SciKit-Learn and linear regression\n",
    "SciKit-Learn is one of the most popular machine learning libraries about there. It allows us to create models very easily! Let's use it to create a simple [linear regression model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#ordinary-least-squares). If you're unfamiliar with linear regression, the idea is to essentially draw a line of best fit through the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The way we do this is by 'fitting' a line based on a set of input data, `X`, and a response variable, `y`. If we're trying to predict crime occurrences, `y` should be the count of occurrences of a specific type of crime in a specific neighborhood. `X` should be the set of predictor features that we are going to use to predict `y`. Feature engineering is the process of creating `X` and `y` from the raw data. We implemented the feature engineering functionality in `denvercrime/src/features/make_features.py`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try to predict how many occurences of drug/alcohol related crimes will occur in Stapleton tomorrow. The first step is to create the training data using the feature engineering functionality. Here are the docstrings for the feature engineering functions, so you can get an idea of how they work. **Note that running the feature engineering functions might take a while.**\n",
